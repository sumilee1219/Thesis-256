  <p id="verse1-1">A simulacrum is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.
The word was first recorded in the  <br> English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, <br>especially of a god.
By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image <br>without the substance or qualities of the original.<br>-Wikipedia-</p>

Then I wake <br><br>
My heart says, what you thought you have
you do not have<br><br>
My body says, will this pounding ever stop?<br>

How did you talk to yourself today?</p>

   it is up to myself and myself alone to emotionally regulate.<br>
it is up to me to lead myself towards things, places, people, <br>and states of mind that embody love and peace.</p>

 <p id="verse1-1-1">“[I]t may be wiser to try to create the place you want to live, rather than to keep trying to find it.”<br>-Frank Bures, "The Fall of the Creative Class"-</p>
  <p id="verse2-2-2">
    I find a home in feeling. I feel at home in feeling. When I collaborate or talk with my friends, the place doesn’t matter. We could be on Mars and it would feel like home, because I feel free. I can be myself. I can be uber-queer, uber-strange, and we can be uber-curious with one another. That’s comforting. Perhaps it’s even harder to protect a home that doesn’t exist in a physical space, because we have to continually tend to this abstract feeling: “How do I create the parameters in which I am safe enough to be free amongst my peers?”<br>
