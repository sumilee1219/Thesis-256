A simulacrum is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.

The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god.

By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.
